1. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Claroline requires the following minimal configuration :

    * Web server with PHP 5.3+ support (PHP 5.4 or 5.5 recommended)
        WARNING : PHP 5.2 or less is not supported anymore !
    * MySQL 5+ compatible database management system with MyISAM engine support
        (MySQL 5.4 or 5.5 recommended, should also work with MySQL 5.6)
    * optionaly an MTA is required for the platform to send emails

Claroline should work on the following Operating systems :

        Linux / BSD / Unix (*)
        Windows
        MacOs X

  (*) Claroline have been tested on Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux
      distributions, but other UNIXes and Linux distributions should work too.
      
      Don't hesitate to notify us of any problem encountered on other
      Linux distributions or UNIX systems.

To install Claroline on a computer, whether locally or remotely,
you need the following on your machine :

1. A web server. We recommend the use Apache2, but Claroline is known to work
with IIS too and should work on any PHP-compatible web server.

2. PHP scripting language (version 5.3 or later), configured with the
   following modules : mysql, zlib, preg. Most of the PHP5 compiled
   distributions are provided with these modules. Anyway, their presence
   is checked by the Claroline install script.

   Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit
   these ones:

        safe_mode            = Off
        magic_quotes_runtime = Off
        short_open_tags      = Off

   Claroline has been tested and works with PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 with CGI 
   (FastCGI or FPM) and apache module. 

   We have also tested under apache2 with the suPHP module.

3. The MySQL databases server (version 5 or later) plus a login/password 
   allowing to administrate and create at least one database.

   Claroline can be installed in two different modes : 'Single
   Database' and 'Multi Database'. In 'Multi Database' mode, Claroline
   will create a new database for each course created. This mode is
   sometimes more appropriate to manage a platform with a huge bulk of
   course sites. But it means the database account used by Claroline
   has to allow to create and administrate several databases. By
   default Claroline is set to be install on a 'single database host'
   If you want to use Claroline in 'Multi Database' mode, you have to
   select this option on purpose at install.

       WARNING ! If you use the 'single database' install option, it is
       recommended to use this database for Claroline use only. If you
       share this database with other applications, interferences could
       occurs between table names of both applications that could conducts
       to serious problems.
   
   Claroline 1.12 has been tested with success with MySQL 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 and 
   should also work with MySQL drop in replacement alternatives like MariaDB, 
   Percona server... given that they have the MyISAM engine enabled.
   

4. (opt) A Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This not absolutely necessary but some
   Claroline features will remain silent if you don't provide MTA.

   Most Linux distributions provide MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, PostFix,
   ...). On Windows machines, no MTA are provided by default. You can
   either modify the php.ini file to redirect mail to an MTA available
   on an other machine, install an MTA on the Claroline server.
   Several MTA are freely available for Windows, or configure a SMTP server
   in Claroline configuration.

2. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
=========================

2.1 NEW CLAROLINE INSTALLATION
------------------------------

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline1xx.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type
   
   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz
   
   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip' with your favorite application.
   
3. FTP or move by any means 'index.php' file and 'web' and 'claroline' 
   directories to your website on web server (whether web root or subdirectory).
   'index.php' should remain where it is, outside 'claroline' and 'web' 
   directories. You can also optionally copy the 'module' directory that 
   contains some common extension modules.
   
   UNIX and Linux : copy the claroline1xx directory to the document root
   of your web server (typically /var/www/).
   
   Windows with wampserver : drag and drop the claroline1xx
   directory to the wampserver document root folder, typically
   c:\Program Files\wamp\www\
   
   MacOSX with MAMP : drag and drop the claroline1xx
   directory to the MAMP document root folder /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/

4. The following folders need to be readable, writeable and executable
   for everyone:
   
   - claroline1xx/
   - claroline1xx/module and all its subfolders
   
   You can change the access rights from the command line under UNIX or Linux :
   chmod ugo+rwx claroline1xx/
   chmod -R ugo+rwx claroline1xx/module

4. Open Web Browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/install/

   Windows : with wampserver locally, open:

   http://localhost/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

   MacOSX : with MAMP locally (running on port 8888), open:

   http://localhost:8888/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

5. Follow instructions.

   Windows: if you use wampserver out of the box, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and no password
   
   MacOSX : if you use MAMP, default connection parameters
   for MySQL are login : root and password : root

   Linux : use the user you have created when installing MySQL or create a user 
   for your Claroline platform
