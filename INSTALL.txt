REQUIREMENTS
============

To install Claroline 1.5.0 on a server, whether locally or 
remotely, you need the following on the server:

1. A web server (We recommend Apache, but others should work too),

2. PHP 4.x configured with the following modules : mysql, zlib, preg.
   Most of the PHP4 compiled distributions are provided with these modules.
   Anyway, their presence is checked by the Claroline install script.

   Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit 
   these ones:

        short_open_tag       = On
        register_globals     = On
        safe_mode            = Off
        magic_quotes_gpc     = On
        magic_quotes_runtime = Off

   For example, users with PHP 4.2 or superior should set the parameter 
   
                 register_globals = on

   and users with PHP 4.3 or superior should also set the parameter 
   
                 magic_quotes_gpc = On


3. The MySQL databases server plus a login/password allowing to administrate 
   and create at least one database. By default, Claroline will create a new 
   database for each course created. It means your host should allow you to 
   create and administrate several databases. If you want to use Claroline on 
   a 'single database host' you have to select this option on purpose at 
   install.

       WARNING ! If you use the 'single database' install option, it is 
       recommended to use this database for Claroline use only. If you 
       share this database with other applications, interferences could 
       occurs between table names of both applications that could conducts 
       to serious problems.

       Note : it seems the backticks charachters (`) inserted inside most of 
       the Claroline SQL queries since Claroline 1.3 doesn't work with MySQL 
       versions previous to 3.23.6.

4. Web Write access to web directory where claroline has been moved 
   or unzipped to. On a Windows machine locally, this
   is not a problem. Remotely, you need to be allowed to CHMOD
   through FTP, telnet or any means.

5. A Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This not absolutely necessary but some 
   Claroline features will remain silent if you don't provide MTA. Most 
   Linux distributions provide MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, PostFix, ...). On 
   Windows machines, no MTA are provided by default. You can either modify 
   the php.ini file to redirect mail to an MTA available on an other 
   machine, or install an MTA on the Claroline server. Several MTA are 
   available for Windows (Blat, Netmail95, WMailto , Hamster ...).


INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

NEW CLAROLINE INSTALLATION
--------------------------

1. Download 'claroline150RC2.tar.gz' 

   Windows : download 'claroline150RC2.zip'.


2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type 

	tar -zxvf claroline150RC2.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline150RC2.zip'.


3. FTP or move by any means 'index.php' file and 'claroline' directory
   to your website on webserver (whether webroot or subdirectory). 
   'index.php' should remain where it is, outside 'claroline' directory. 

   Windows: If you use easyphp locally (http://www.easyphp.org), just 
   drag and drop 'index.php' file and 'claroline' directory into 
   C:\Program Files\easyphp\www\

4. Open Web Browser and go to 

	http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/install/

   Windows : with easyphp locally, open: 

	http://localhost/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

5. Follow instructions.

   Windows: if you use easyPhp out of the box, login and password 
   for MySQL should remain empty.


UPDGRADE FROM PREVIOUS CLAROLINE VERSION
----------------------------------------

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do a full backup of the previous 
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this 
please ask your hosting provider for advice.


1. Download 'claroline150RC2.tar.gz'

   Windows : download 'claroline150RC2.zip'.


2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

	tar -zxvf claroline150RC2.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline150RC2.zip'.


3. Replace your previous Claroline directory and index.php by the new one.

       WARNING ! Don't delete the previous directory before installing the new 
       one. You will loose your previous configuration files 
       (eg 'config.inc.php'). Simply replace the old directory with a new one 
       with a 'copy' command. That way, the new file versions will overwrite the 
       old ones and leave the others intact.

4. Open Web Browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/admin/maintenance/upgrade.php

   Windows with easyPhp locally, open:

   http://localhost/mydir/claroline/admin/maintenance/upgrade.php

5. Follow instructions.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

In case web install doesn't work, you can try manual install. 
All the same as web install except that web parts should be replaced by:

1. Create yourself the main Claroline database and the tables inside it 
   with a mySQL client (we provide the web client phpMyAdmin in the Claroline
   distribution). The complete tables description is available in 
   the 'claroline/sql/' directory.

2. Edit manually the 'claroline/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php.dist' file 
   and rename it 'claro_main.conf.php'.

3. Open browser, go to your new campus URL and click 'Registration', then 
   selecting 'Create course websites' and follow the line.

4. Go, if needed, to 'http://www.claroline.net' and ask a question on the 
   Support forum. Read however the previous messages to see if there is 
   already an answer to your question.



ADMINISTRATION SECTION
======================

To access the Claroline administration section, open browser 
and go to http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydirectory/admin/

Install script has created a '.htaccess' file to protect 
claroline/admin. To access admin, use login/password you 
entered during install.

If this doesn't work, delete '.htaccess'.
