REQUIREMENTS
============

To install Claroline 1.8.alpha on a computer, whether locally or remotely,
you need the following on your machine :

1. One of the following Operating systems :

        Linux / BSD / Unix (*)
        Windows (9x, Me, NT4, 2000, XP)
        MacOs X.

  (*) We thoroughly test Claroline on Debian and Mandrake distributions,
      but other Linux distributions should work too. We've received
      positive feedbacks from users working on Red Hat and Suse.
      Don't hesitate to notify us of any problem encountered on other
      Linux distributions.

1. A web server (We recommend Apache, but others should work too),

2. PHP scripting language (version 4.3 or later), configured with the
   following modules : mysql, zlib, preg. Most of the PHP4 compiled
   distributions are provided with these modules. Anyway, their presence
   is checked by the Claroline install script.

   Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit
   these ones:

        safe_mode            = Off
        magic_quotes_runtime = Off

3. The MySQL databases server plus a login/password allowing to
   administrate and create at least one database.

   Claroline can be installed in tow different modes : 'Single
   Database' and 'Multi Database'. In 'Multi Database' mode, Claroline
   will create a new database for each course created. This mode is
   sometimes more appropriate to manage a platform with a huge bulk of
   course sites. But it means the database account used by Claroline
   has to allow to create and administrate several databases. By
   default Claroline is set to be install on a 'single database host'
   If you want to use Claroline in 'Multi Database' mode, you have to
   select this option on purpose at install.

       WARNING ! If you use the 'single database' install option, it is
       recommended to use this database for Claroline use only. If you
       share this database with other applications, interferences could
       occurs between table names of both applications that could conducts
       to serious problems.

       NOTE 1. The backticks characters (`) inserted inside most of the
       Claroline SQL queries since Claroline 1.3 doesn't work with MySQL
       versions previous to 3.23.6.

       NOTE 2. People using MySQL 4.1 (or later) could face connection
       problem. To fix this problem, see on the my SQL web site :

            "Client does not support authentication protocol"
            http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html

4. Web Write access to web directory where Claroline has been moved
   or unzipped to. On a Windows machine locally, this
   is not a problem. Remotely, you need to be allowed to CHMOD
   through FTP, telnet or any means.

5. A Mail Transport Agent (MTA). This not absolutely necessary but some
   Claroline features will remain silent if you don't provide MTA.
   Most Linux distributions provide MTA (Sendmail, Qmail, PostFix,
   ...). On Windows machines, no MTA are provided by default. You can
   either modify the php.ini file to redirect mail to an MTA available
   on an other machine, or install an MTA on the Claroline server.
   Several MTA are freely available for Windows (Mercury, Blat,
   Netmail95, WMailto , Hamster ...).

   Windows : unzip 'claroline18.alpha.zip'.

3. FTP or move by any means 'index.php' file and 'claroline' directory
   to your website on web server (whether web root or subdirectory).
   'index.php' should remain where it is, outside 'claroline' directory.

   Windows: If you use easyphp locally (http://www.easyphp.org), just
   drag and drop 'index.php' file and 'claroline' directory into
   C:\Program Files\easyphp\www\

4. Open Web Browser and go to

    http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/install/

   Windows : with easyphp locally, open:

    http://localhost/claroline/install/ (don't forget the final /).

5. Follow instructions.

   Windows: if you use easyphp out of the box, login and password
   for MySQL should remain empty.



   UPGRADE DOESN'T WORK FOR alpha and beta releases.



TROUBLESHOOTING
