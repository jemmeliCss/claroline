                    CLAROLINE EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM

This system allows Claroline to rely on external system concerning 
authentication and user profile management. It is based on a collection of 
authentication drivers stored inside the Claroline/auth/extauth/drivers 
directory.

These drivers can be loaded by the Claroline kernel when a user attempt to log 
on the platform.

To use one of these drivers

1. Open the concerned driver into a text editor and adapt the parameters to your 
own context.

2. Uncomment the concerned line in the main Claroline configuration file 
(claroline/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php)


                                 HOW IT WORKS ?

These drivers can be called by the Claroline authentication system in two 
circumstances.

1. When a user has never logged to the platform beforehand, ant try to log in to 
Claroline for the first time. No record concerning this user are found into the 
Claroline system, so it attempts to look for this user on the external 
authentication systems list specified by its configuration file. When it founds 
it, Claroline duplicates the user profile into its own user table, stating that 
it comes for this specific external authentication system.

	The driver treating this case is called by the Claroline Kernel by line like 
	this below into the Claroline configuration file.

	$extAuthSource['authSourceName']['newUser'] = "path/file";

2. When a user log to the platform next time. A record concerning this user is 
already stored into the Claroline system. From this record Claroline is able to 
know from where does this user profile comes. And it try to connect to the 
concerned external authentication system to check if this user account is still 
allowed to connect with this password. It also takes the occasion to update from 
the external authentication system the user data stored into the Claroline 
system.

	The driver treating this case is called by the Claroline Kernel by line like 
	this below into the Claroline configuration file.

	$extAuthSource['authSourceName']['login'  ] = = "path/file";


                                DRIVER SETTINGS

Each Claroline driver sets 5 parameters.

- $authSourceName : set the identity of the external authentication source 

    example : $authSourceName = 'phpnuke';

- $authSourceType : set the technical type of the of the external authentication 
  source

    example : $authSourceName = 'DB';

- $extAuthOptionList : set the parameters needed to connect to the external 
  authentication source and the field to to retrieve in it.

    example : $extAuthOptionList = array(

                    'url'      => 'ldap://server_address',
                    'port'     => '636',
                    'basedn'   => 'ou=personne,o=your organisation unit,c=domaine',
                    'userattr' => 'uid',
                    'useroc'   => 'person',
                    'attributes' => array('sn', 'givenName', 'telephoneNumber','mail'),

                );

- $extAuthAttribNameList : set how the data retrieved from the external 
  authentication source matches the Claroline data structure. The keys are the 
  Claroline attributes and the value are the authentication external attributes.    

    example : $extAuthAttribNameList = array (

                    'lastname'     => 'sn',
                    'firstname'    => 'givenName',
                    'email'        => 'mail',
                    'phoneNumber'  => 'telephoneNumber',
                    'authSource'   => 'ldap'

                );

- $extAuthAttribTreatmentList : set any optional preliminary treatment to the 
  data retrieved from the external authentication source before committing it into 
  Claroline. The keys are the concerned Claroline attribute, and the values are 
  the name of the function which make the treatment. You can use standard PHP 
  function or functions defined by your own.

        $extAuthAttribTreatmentList = array (

                'lastname'     => 'utf8_decode',
                'firstname'    => 'utf8_decode',
                'loginName'    => 'utf8_decode',
                'email'        => 'utf8_decode',
                'officialCode' => 'utf8_decode',
                'phoneNumber'  => 'utf8_decode',
                'status'       => 'treat_status_from_extauth_to_claroline'

        );
