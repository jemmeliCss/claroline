  <li>Multiple choice (multiple answers)</li>

  <li>Matching</li>

  <li>Fill in the blanks</li>

</ul>

An exercise gathers a number of questions under a common theme.</p>

<hr>

<b>Exercise creation</b>

<p>In order to create an exercise, click on the link &quot;New exercise&quot;.<br><br>

Type the exercise name, as well as an optional description of it.<br><br>

You can also choose between 2 exercise types :<br><br>

<ul>

  <li>Questions on an unique page</li>

  <li>One question per page (sequential)</li>

</ul>

and choose if you want questions to be randomly sorted or not at the time of the exercise running.<br><br>

Then, save your exercise. Then go to the question administration for this exercise.</p>

<hr>

<b>Question adding</b>

<p>You can now add a question into the exercise previously created. The description is optional, as well as the possibility of linking a picture to your question.</p>

<hr>

<b>Multiple choice</b>

<p>This is the famous MAQ (multiple answer question) / MCQ (multiple choice question).<br><br>

In order to create a MAQ / MCQ :<br><br>

<ul>

  <li>Define answers for your question. You can add or delete an answer by clicking on the right button</li>

  <li>Check the correct answer(s) in the left box </li>

  <li>Add an optional comment. This comment won't be seen by the student until (s)he has replied to the question</li>

  <li>Give a weighting to each answer. The weighting can be any positive or negative integer, or zero</li>

  <li>Save your answers</li>

</ul></p>

<hr>

<b>Fill in the blanks</b>

<p>This allows you to create a text with gaps. The aim is to let student find words that you have removed from the text.<br><br>

To remove a word from the text, so creating a blank, put the word between brackets [like this].<br><br>

Once the text has been typed and blanks defined, you can add a comment that will be seen by the student when (s)he replies to the question.<br><br>

Save your text, and you will then go to the next step which will allow you to give a weighting to each blank. For example, if the question is worth 10 points and you have 5 blanks, you can give a weighting of 2 points to each blank.</p>

<hr>

<b>Matching</b>

<p>This answer type can be chosen so as to create a question where the student will have to connect elements from a unit U1 with elements from a unit U2.<br><br>

It can also be used to ask students to sort elements in a certain order.<br><br>

First define the options amongst which the student will be able to choose the right answer. Then, define the questions which will have to be linked to one of the options previously defined. Finally, connect via the drop-down menu elements from the first unit with those of the second one.<br><br>

Notice : Several elements from the first unit can point to the same element in the second unit.<br><br>

Give a weighting to each correct matching, and save your answer.</p>

<hr>

<b>Exercise modification</b>

<p>In order to modify an exercise, the principle is the same as for its creation. Just click on the picture <img src=\"img/edit.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the exercise to modify it, and follow instructions above.</p>

<hr>

<b>Exercise deleting</b>

<p>In order to delete an exercise, click on the picture <img src=\"img/delete.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the exercise to delete it.</p>

<hr>

<b>Exercise enabling</b>

<p>To enable an exercise to be used, you have to enable it by clicking on the picture <img src=\"img/invisible.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the exercise.</p>

<hr>

<b>Exercise running</b>

<p>You can test your exercise by clicking on its name in the exercise list.</p>

<hr>

<b>Random exercises</b>

<p>At the time of an exercise creation / modification, you can tell if you want questions to be drawn in a random order among all questions of the exercise.<br><br>

That means that, by enabling this option, questions will be drawn in a different order each time students will run the exercise.<br><br>

If you have got a large number of questions, you can also choose to randomly draw only X questions amongst all questions available in that exercise.</p>

<hr>

<b>Question pool</b>

<p>When you delete an exercise, questions of its own are not removed from the database, and can be reused in a new exercise, via the question pool.<br><br>

The question pool also allows you to reuse the same questions in several exercises.<br><br>

By default, all questions of your course are shown. You can show the questions related to an exercise, by chosing this one in the drop-down menu &quot;Filter&quot;.<br><br>

Orphan questions are questions that don't belong to any exercise.</p>";

<p>This tool allows to create and manage work groups.

At creation (Create groups), groups are emtpy. There are

many ways to fill them:

<ul><li>automatically ('Fill groups'),</li>

<li>manually ('Edit'),</li>

<li>self-registration by students (Groups settings: 'Self registration allowed...').</li>

</ul>

These three ways can be combined. You can, for instance, ask students to self-register first.

Then discover that some of them didn't and decide then to fill groups automatically in

order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership one student

at a time after or before self-registration and/or automatical filling.</p>

<p>Group filling, whether automatical or manual, works only if there are already students

registered in the course (don't mix registration to the course with registration into groups).

Students list is visible in <b>Users</b> tool. </p><hr noshade size=1>

<p><b>Create groups</b></p>

<p>To create new groups, click on 'Create new group(s)' and determine number of groups to

create. Maximum number of members is optional but we suggest to chose one. If you leave max. field

unchanged, groups size maximum will be infinite.</p><hr noshade size=1>

<p><b>Group settings</b></p>

<p>You can determine Group settings globally (for all groups).

<b>Students are allowed to self-register in groups</b>:

<p>You create empty groups, students self-register.

If you have defined a maximum number, full groups do not accept new members.

This method is good for teachers who do not know the list of students when

creating groups.</p>

<p>Every group possesses either a forum (private or public) or a Documents area

(a shared file manager) or (most frequently) both.</p>
