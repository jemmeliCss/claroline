<p>The <em>Claroline Upgrade Tool</em> will retrieve the data of your previous Claroline
installation and set them to be compatible with the new Claroline version. This upgrade proceeds in three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
It will get your previous platform main settings and put them in a new configuration files
</li>
<li>
It will set the main Claroline tables (user, course categories, course list, ...) to be compatible with the new data structure.
</li>
<li>
It will update one by one each course data (directories, database tables, ...)

Before starting the <em>Claroline Upgrade Tool</em>, 
we recommend you to make yourself a complete backup of
