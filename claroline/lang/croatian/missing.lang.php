<p>This tool allows to create and manage work groups.

At creation (Create groups), groups are emtpy. There are

many ways to fill them:

<ul><li>automatically ('Fill groups'),</li>

<li>manually ('Edit'),</li>

<li>self-registration by students (Groups settings: 'Self registration allowed...').</li>

</ul>

These three ways can be combined. You can, for instance, ask students to self-register first.

Then discover that some of them didn't and decide then to fill groups automatically in

order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership one student

at a time after or before self-registration and/or automatical filling.</p>

<p>Group filling, whether automatical or manual, works only if there are already students

registered in the course (don't mix registration to the course with registration into groups).

Students list is visible in <b>Users</b> tool. </p><hr noshade size=1>

<p><b>Create groups</b></p>

<p>To create new groups, click on 'Create new group(s)' and determine number of groups to

create. Maximum number of members is optional but we suggest to chose one. If you leave max. field

unchanged, groups size maximum will be infinite.</p><hr noshade size=1>

<p><b>Group settings</b></p>

<p>You can determine Group settings globally (for all groups).

<b>Students are allowed to self-register in groups</b>:

<p>You create empty groups, students self-register.

If you have defined a maximum number, full groups do not accept new members.

This method is good for teachers who do not know the list of students when

creating groups.</p>

<b>Tools</b>:</p>

<p>Every group possesses either a forum (private or public) or a Documents area

(a shared file manager) or (most frequently) both.</p>

<hr noshade size=1>

<p><b>Manual edit</b></p>

<p>Once groups are created (Create groups), you see at bottom of page, a list of groups

with a series of information and functions

<ul><li><b>Edit</b> to modify manually Group name, description, tutor,

members list.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> deletes a group.</li></ul>

 There is a small example in every tool to help you quickly grasp how it

 works. It is up to you to modify the example or to delete it.</p><p>For

 instance, here on the Home Page of your course website,there is a small

 introduction text saying 'This is the introduction text of your course. To

 replace it by your own text, click below on modify.' Click on modify, edit

 it and Ok. It's that simple. Every tool has the same logic:

 add, delete, modify, which is the logic of dynamic websites.</p><p>When

 you first create your website, most of the tools are active. Here again,

 it is up to you to deactivate the ones you don't need. You just have to

 click on 'deactivate'. Then it goes down to the grey section of your

 homepage and becomes invisible to your students.  However, you can

 reactivate it whenever you want, making it visible to the students once more.</p>

<p>You can add your own pages to your

 Home Page. These pages must be HTML pages (which can be created by any

 Word Processor or Web Composer). Use 'Upload page and link to Homepage' to

 send your page to the server. The standard header of your website will be

 automatically merged with your new document, so that you just need to

 concentrate on the content. If you want to link from your Home to

 existing websites or pages existing anywhere on the web (even inside your

 own site), use 'Add link on Homepage' The pages you have added to the Home

 page can deactivated then deleted, where the standard tools can be

 deactivated, but not deleted.</p><p>Once your course website is ready, go

 to 'Modify course info' and decide what level of confidentiality you want.

 By default, your course is hidden (because you work on it).</p>";
