2. UPGRADE PROCEDURE
====================

2.1 UNDERSTANDING CLAROLINE VERSION NUMBERS
-------------------------------------------

Claroline version numbers are of the form 1.X.Y where X and Y are two numbers.
X is called the major version number, while Y is called the minor version number

For example : in version number 1.11.5, 11 is the major version number and 5 is
the minor version number

In other words, Claroline major versions differ by the major version number (for
example 1.4.1 and 1.10.6), while minor versions have the same major version
number but differ by the minor version number (for example 1.10.1 and 1.10.6).

This is important for the Claroline upgrade process. If you want to upgrade
Claroline between two different major version (let's say 1.9 and 1.10), you
have to follow the instructions in section 2.2.2. If you want to upgrade
Claroline between two minor versions of the same major version (let's say
1.10.1 and 1.10.6), you have to follow the instructions given in section 2.2.3.

2.2 UPDGRADE FROM PREVIOUS CLAROLINE MAJOR VERSION  (ex: 1.11 to 1.12)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING : if you are upgrading from 1.10 to 1.11, follow the instruction given
in section 2.4 instead of those below !

The upgrade works only from Claroline 1.5.x and above.
Older Claroline versions should upgrade first to Claroline 1.5.x before
upgrade to superior versions.

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do A FULL BACKUP of the previous
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice.

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz' (UNIX, Linux) or 'claroline1xx.zip' (Windows)

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip'

3. Delete your directories claroline/ and web/, and then replace them with the new 
   ones you've just extracted.  Do the same for your index.php file and the 
   .txt files.

   If you do not have a module/ directory in your old Claroline, you can copy the
   one provided in the archive. If you already have a module/ directory, you can
   copy the new CLCHAT module to this directory.


        WARNING ! Don't delete the previous directories and files before
        installing the new ones. You will loose your previous
        configuration files (eg 'claro_main.conf.php'). Simply
        replace the old directory with a new one with a 'copy'
        command. That way, the new file versions will overwrite the
        old ones and leave the others intact.
        
        Configuration files are located in /platform/conf/

4. Open a Web browser and go to

   http://www.mydomain.org/mysite/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

   Windows with easyPhp or WampServer locally, open:

   http://localhost/mydir/claroline/admin/upgrade/upgrade.php

5. Follow instructions.

2.3 UPGRADE FROM A PREVIOUS CLAROLINE MINOR VERSION
---------------------------------------------------

NOTE : this is also the way to upgrade Claroline from version 1.10 to version 
1.11

Follow the following instructions to upgrade to a new minor version of the same
major version of Claroline (for example to upgrade from Claroline 1.10.1 to
1.10.6)

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do A FULL BACKUP of the previous
Claroline directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice.

1. Download 'claroline1xx.tar.gz'

   Windows : download 'claroline1xx.zip'

2. Open a shell, go to download directory and type

   tar -zxvf claroline1xx.tar.gz

   Windows : unzip 'claroline1xx.zip'

3. Delete your directories claroline/ and web/, and then replace them with the new 
   ones you've just extracted.  Do the same for your index.php file and the 
   .txt files.

4. Go to your campus home page to check that the platform is still running
   correctly.

5. That's all !
